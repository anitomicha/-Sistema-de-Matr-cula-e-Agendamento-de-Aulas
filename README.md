📝 Diário de Projeto — Dia 1
📆 Data: 27/05/2025
👩🏽‍💻 Projeto: Sistema de Matrícula e Agendamento de Aulas (Frontend)
🔧 Tecnologias: React.js, Tailwind CSS, date-fns, Sonner (toast)

✅ O que foi feito hoje:
Criação inicial do projeto React

Utilizei o create-react-app para iniciar um projeto chamado matricula-app.

Criação da estrutura de pastas
Criei uma pasta components dentro de src para organizar os componentes do projeto.
Implementação do componente de formulário
Desenvolvi o componente MatriculaAgendamento.jsx 
Incluí um botão de confirmação com validações simples.
Estilização com Tailwind CSS
Apliquei uma interface limpa e responsiva com classes do Tailwind.
Notificações com Sonner
Configurei o react-sonner para exibir mensagens de sucesso e erro de validação.
Manipulação de datas com date-fns
Instalei a biblioteca date-fns para formatar a data no campo do tipo date.
Correções de erros
Corrigi erros de importação e estrutura (ex: pasta componentes → components).
Instalei dependências ausentes, como date-fns.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
